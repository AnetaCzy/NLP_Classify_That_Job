# NLP_Classify_That_Job
NLP project, developed as part of a Bachelor, thesis that explores the implementation of three machine learning algorithms—Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Logistic Regression—to classify job posting descriptions based on textual data. The research involves preprocessing job descriptions, extracting relevant features, and applying these algorithms to categorize job postings into specific occupation classes. The project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these algorithms in the context of job classification, providing insights into their performance for text-based data analysis.
